# Run the ShapeTrace Leaderboard Dashboard 
#### Grisha Bandodkar and Madhav Rajesh
## Instructions:
1. Must have node and npm installed
2. Must have the backend environment variables - the MongoDB username and password, and AWS certificates (Note: This is not currently provided within this repository as this is public, but please contact gbandodkar@ucdavis.edu to be able to run the dashboard locally)
3. In a terminal where the working directory is `backend/` within this project, run `nodemon server`
4. In a second terminal where the working directory is the main directory of the project, run `npm start`. This will launch a tab in your browser with the url `localhost:3000/` where the dashboard is running.
